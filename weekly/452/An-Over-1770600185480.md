After reading [Stefan Bauer&#8217;s fancy idea for toggling a video preview](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/performance-optimized-video-embeds-with-zero-javascript/) to a real embedded video with a `<details>` element, it had me thinking just how powerful having an generic &#8220;toggle&#8221; is in HTML. In CSS, ages ago, we [got the `:checked` pseudo selector](https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/), and it has been used to gosh-danged high heaven to make interactive things on websites. It&#8217;s just a toggle. And now toggles are getting easier and easier to make. 

On top of that, we don&#8217;t have to be as tricky with how we structure things to use that toggle. When all we had was `:checked`, we had to use `:checked ~ .something-else` style selectors to do more interesting things on the page. Now we essentially just don&#8217;t have to. 

body:has(#toggle:checked) {
  /* style the body */

  .something-else {
    /* style anything else */
  }
}Code language: CSS (css)

DOM be damned. 

This is basically the same with a `<details>` element (toggle). 

details {
  /* style the <details> */

  &&#91;open] {
    /* style the details when it is open */
  }

  body:has(&&#91;open]) {
     /* style the body when the details is open */

     .something-else {
       /* style something else when body has an open details element */
     }
  }
}Code language: CSS (css)

That feels like weirdly a lot of power 😅.

That had me thinking we could basically reveal another entire background (almost like a `::backdrop`) that covers everything but the details (just to call a ton of attention to it, again like a modal).

That&#8217;s probably about enough being weird for a Wednesday.
